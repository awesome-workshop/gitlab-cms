- "Know how to source the CMSSW environment."
- "Understand the different commands that need to be used."
keypoints:

Before getting into details, a few links to useful documentation on GitLab
CI/CD and also CERN-specific information:

- [GitLab CI/CD documentation][gitlab-ci]
- [CERN Knowledge Base Articles for the Git Service][snow-git]

These pages serve as a good entry point in case of problems and questions.

{: .callout}

The commands would look like this (replace `${USER}` with your CERN
username in case it isn't the same as on your laptop):

~~~
mkdir -p ~/awesome-workshop
cd awesome-workshop
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/${USER}/awesome-gitlab-cms.git
cd awesome-gitlab-cms
~~~
{: .language-bash}

## Choosing the correct GitLab runner

We are now going to set up a GitLab CI. For that, we need to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
Standard [GitLab CI runners at CERN](https://gitlab.docs.cern.ch/docs/Build%20your%20application/CI-CD/Runners/)
do not mount CVMFS, which is required in many cases, for example, for setting up CMSSW, to create a grid proxy, or to access LCG software stacks in `/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/`.
In order to get a runner that mounts CVMFS, you need
to add a `tag` to your `gitlab-ci.yml` file:

~~~
tags:
  - cvmfs
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

A minimal `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to get a runner with CVMFS looks like the following:

~~~
cmssw_setup:
  tags:
    - cvmfs
  script:
    - ls /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

The `cmssw_setup` line defines the name of the job, and all the job does is
list `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/`, which would fail if CVMFS isn't mounted. 

To trigger the pipeline, we need to commit the file and push it to GitLab:

~~~
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "added a CI"
git push
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you now navigate the GitLab UI with your browser, you will see the CI running and eventually finishing.
You can check the output, and also the `cvmfs` label:

![A job with a GitLab CVMFS Runner showing the cvmfs label](../fig/cvmfs_tag.png)

In the following, you'll learn how to set up a GitLab CI job that runs CMSSW.

This should be regarded as an example for any CI job requiring access to CVMFS and accessing CMS-restricted files.

## Setting up CMSSW

> ## CMS-specific setup
> Since the default user in the runner is not your username and the container doesn't
> know anything about you in the first place, it doesn't have any
> CMS-related environment as people registered as CMS members (via the _zh_

{: .callout}

To set up a CMSSW release (for example `CMSSW_10_6_30`), you would usually
run the following commands on LXPLUS:

~~~
cmssw-el7
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_30
cd CMSSW_10_6_30/src
cmsenv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first command is needed because CMSSW_10_6_30 is pretty old (we chose an old one on purpose!), and it does not have any build for the recent alma9 LXPLUS. 
So we need to start a CentOS7 container first, which we do with the `cmssw-el7` command, as described in the [CMS singularity guide](https://cms-sw.github.io/singularity.html).

Depending on the software version chosen, the third command may print out a warning such as

~~~
WARNING: Developer's area is created for non-production architecture slc7_amd64_gcc820. Production architecture for this release is slc7_amd64_gcc700.
~~~
{: .output}

which can be ignored in this case (or could be removed by first executing
`export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700`).

The command `source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh` sets several
environment variables, in particular adding `/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/common` to
the `${PATH}`. You can check this by running `echo ${PATH}`. Another effect
of this command is that a few helper functions are defined, such as `cmsrel` and `cmsenv`.

A common pitfall when setting up CMSSW in GitLab is that the execution
fails because the setup script doesn't follow best practices for shell
scripts, such as returning non-zero return values even if the setup is OK or
using unset variables. Even if the script exits without a visible error message,
there could be something wrong. It is therefore often a good idea to
circumvent issues like that by disabling strict checks (issuing `set +u`) before running the
setup command and enabling these checks afterwards again (issuing `set -u`).

> The `image` directive tells the GitLab runner that it should run in a CentOS7 container, just like you would manually do on LXPLUS issuing `cmssw-el7`.
> The `set +u` command turns off errors for referencing unset variables. It isn't really needed here, since `-u` (i.e., not allowing to use unset variables) isn't set by default, but the script would fail if one used `set -u` somewhere else, so it's safer to catch this here.
{: .solution}

The reason why in the example above the variable `${CMS_PATH}` is used and not simply
`/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch` directly is just to mimic the default environment you would get on
LXPLUS. You can check if this is the case for you as well by running `env | grep CMS_PATH`
after logging on to LXPLUS.

You can see some examples in the [payload GitLab repository][payload-gitlab-cms] for this lesson.
